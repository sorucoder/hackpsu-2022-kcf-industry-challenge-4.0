<p>This page will be for fan specs like type, average speed, average velocity, etc...</p>
<p>It's not pretty yet because we didn't have time to fix it up but it would just show an unordered list of specs of the fans to keep in mind when calculating data</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type of fan: Probably industrial</li>
  <li>Speed: Probably an average of a lot</li>
  <li>Velocity: Probably pretty fast</li>
  <li>You get the point right: Hopefully yes</li>
  
  
</ul>
